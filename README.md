Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration

Load the dataset from Kaggle.
Perform data cleaning and handle missing values if any.
Detect and handle outliers.
Perform feature engineering, which may include creating new features from existing ones.
Visualize the data using Matplotlib to gain insights.
Step 2: Model Building with Scikit-Learn and Linear Regression

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Build a linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data (e.g., using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, etc.).
Save the trained model for future use.
Step 3: Building a Flask Server

Set up a Flask application to create a web server.
Create an API endpoint that receives input (e.g., square ft area, bedrooms) and returns the predicted house price using the trained model.
Step 4: Developing the UI

Create an HTML form that allows users to input the necessary features (square ft area, bedrooms, etc.).
Use CSS to style the form and make it visually appealing.
Use JavaScript to capture user input and send a request to the Flask server.
Display the predicted house price on the website.
Step 5: Model Refinement and Optimization

Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's generalization ability.
Refine the model based on the evaluation results.
